Create a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes this website:

https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/

...and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, etc.

Avoid using an "image scraper" or "image downloader" library that does multiple steps at once for you (eg. do not use [`image-downloader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-downloader) or [`nodejs-file-downloader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodejs-file-downloader) or similar) - break the task down into smaller steps and select libraries as necessary for each step.

Make sure that the meme images are "ignored" in Git - they should not show up in your repository.

The program should be able to run multiple times without throwing an error.

## TODOs

This is a placeholder for you to enter your todos.

Stretch goals:

- Make the application create your own custom meme (eg. `node index.js hello karl bender` would download an image with the top text of "hello", the bottom text of "karl", with the meme image of Bender)
- Add a nice progress indicator (either messages or a progress bar)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Preflight runs through without errors in your project
  - [ ] Link in your GitHub repo's About section: repl.it demo
- [ ] [Drone bot](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/btcmp-l-webfs-gen-0/modules/cheatsheet-tasks/#upleveled-drone) has been tagged and responded with a passing message
- [ ] Correct GitHub commit message format (see [Writing Commit Messages](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/btcmp-l-webfs-gen-0/modules/cheatsheet-git-github/#writing-commit-messages))


unresolved questions:

- what does scrape mean?
  - extracting, taking information from some location

----

## TODO

- [x] Create a folder called `memes`
- [x] Create a JavaScript file called `index.js` to hold the code
- [x] Create the `.gitignore` file
  - [x] Add a new line at the bottom of the file with the name of the `memes` folder
- [x] Visit the memes website URL (the Netlify link)
  - [x] Request the server for data (the server is the computer on which the website is saved) - also called "creating a request" or "connecting to the website"
  - [x] The data returned will include an HTML string
- [x] Process the HTML string to create an array of image URLs
  - [x] Search the website HTML for the `src` of the `img` tags (this will be the URL of the image)
- [x] Loop over the array of image URLs
  - [x] Limit the loop to only the first ten images
  - [x] Download the image data from the URL in a variable
  - [x] Save the image data in the folder `memes` with the file names `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, etc
- [x] Test the program by running `node index.js` multiple times
